Generates an empty Debug Project with the requested executable as part of the solution. 

Script doesn't check if the executable you request exists, or if you actually provided a full path and not just line noise, but given it's just rendering to a template any mistakes can be corrected by just re-running the script with the correct arguments.

Usage:
args.py "C:\full\path\to\executable.exe" [-w "E:\full\path\to\working\directory"]

If no working directory is provided, the directory containing the executable to be debugged is used.

Requires Jinja2 (pip install jinja2) or http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Jinja2
